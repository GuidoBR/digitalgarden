# How Not to Be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking - by Jordan Ellenberg

## [How math secretly affects your life](https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/How-Not-to-be-Wrong)

by Bill Gates

> The book starts with a story about Abraham Wald, an Eastern European  mathematician who worked for the American government during World War  II. One day the military came to him and said, “We have a problem. We  send our planes overseas, and when they come back, their engines are  fine, but their tails are riddled with bullet holes. If we put more  armor on the tails, though, the planes get too heavy to fly. Can you  help us figure out how to protect the planes’ tails better?”
>
> And he said, “No.” 
>
> They were surprised, but then he explained that they were asking the wrong question. “You need to put more armor where there *aren’t* bullet holes. Clearly, when the plane gets hit in the tail, it makes it back to you. Your problem is the planes that get hit in the engine,  because those are the ones that aren’t coming back.”
>
> Ultimately, that’s really what the book is: a series of stories about how a lot of the apparently non-mathematical systems that underpin our  daily lives are actually deeply mathematical, and people couldn’t  develop them until they started asking the right questions.

> What Ellenberg has written is ultimately a love letter to math. If the  stories he tells add up to a larger lesson, it’s that “to do mathematics is to be, at once, touched by fire and bound by reason”
