> ### by Money Stuff: Russia’s Money Is Gone
>
> One great theme of the post-2008 financial world is that **money is a social construct**, **a way to keep track of *what society thinks you deserve* in terms of goods and services**. That has always been true, but modern  finance has made it more obvious. I think that 15 years ago it was  easier to think that money was an objective fact. Money is a kind of  stuff, you might have thought, stuff with some predictable value that  you can exchange for goods and services, and you can acquire a quantity  of it and then you own that money and can use it however you like to buy things. 
>
> But the response to the 2008  global financial crisis, and to its later European aftershocks, made it  clear that something else was going on. Who has money and what they can  do with it can be adjusted by the actions of central banks and national  treasuries; banks can be bailed out; costs can be socialized. The fiscal response to Covid-19 reinforced this point: Money is a tool of social  decision-making, not an objective thing that you get through abstract  merit.
>
> There has also been the enormous rise of cryptocurrency, which taught two somewhat opposite lessons about this  theme. On the one hand, the value of cryptocurrency is *so clearly* socially constructed: A Bitcoin was worth roughly nothing a decade ago, and  roughly $41,000 today, solely because people collectively decided to  ascribe value to Bitcoin. Bitcoin provided a clear and salient example  of the fact that money gets its value from people agreeing that it’s  valuable.
>
> On the other hand, though, crypto enthusiasts have always pitched it as a way *around* the traditional methods of social construction of money. Crypto is  unregulated money, censorship-resistant money, money whose value is not  subject to the whims of a central bank. These claims are [ not always true in practice](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/26861424.211848/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9vcGluaW9uL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDItMDkvYnVzaW5lc3MtcmFwcGVyLXdhcy1iYWQtYXQtYml0Y29pbi1sYXVuZGVyaW5nP2NtcGlkPUJCRDAyMjgyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDIyOCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/5ffc7c709470997ea156044aBf1e293a9) — as crypto has become more valuable and more integrated with the  mainstream financial system, it has become more subject to the same  sorts of regulation — but they do highlight how the traditional system  works. “Money is only useful if the government lets you use it” is now a thing that a lot of people believe, though often with the corollary  “but Bitcoin fixes that.”

But “foreign currency reserves” are  not an objective fact; they are mostly a series of entries on lists  maintained by foreign-currency issuers and intermediaries (central  banks, correspondent banks, sovereign bond issuers, brokerages).[1] If  those people cross you off the list, or put an asterisk next to your  entry freezing your funds, then you can’t use those funds anymore.

And those banks can be blocked from engaging in transactions involving Russia’s central bank. To do this to a fellow central bank involves breaking the assumption of sovereign equality and the common interest in upholding the rights to property. It is a major  step not easily taken against a central bank as important and as much  part of the Western networks as the central bank of Russia.

There are the Bitcoiners’ complaints: Financial transactions  are a private matter, letting authorities interfere with them is bad for freedom, dictators (or democracies) can arbitrarily cut off money to  people they dislike, etc. But there are also [more specific complaints](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/26861424.211848/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuaXdwLmVkdS93cC1jb250ZW50L3VwbG9hZHMvMjAxOS8wNS9XZWFwb25pemVkLWludGVyZGVwZW5kZW5jZS1ob3ctZ2xvYmFsLWVjb25vbWljLW5ldHdvcmtzLXNoYXBlLXN0YXRlLWNvZXJjaW9uLnBkZg/5ffc7c709470997ea156044aB214635e6) about “weaponizing the dollar”: The U.S.-dollar-based international  financial system, and the international financial system broadly, is an  extremely valuable engine for global prosperity because people basically trust it to be reliable and neutral and rules-based; they trust that a  dollar in a bank is usable and fungible, that the dollar system protects property rights.[2] “Money is a social construct,” sure, in the back of everyone’s mind, but it is a well-constructed construct, one that  works. Making the Russian central bank’s money disappear undermines that valuable trust. This is arguably bad for the dollar’s long-run  dominance: Russia will develop its own [ ways around SWIFT](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/26861424.211848/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDItMjUvd2FsbC1zdHJlZXQtY291bnNlbHMtd2FzaGluZ3Rvbi1hZ2FpbnN0LWtpY2tpbmctcnVzc2lhLW9mZi1zd2lmdD9jbXBpZD1CQkQwMjI4MjJfTU9ORVlTVFVGRiZ1dG1fbWVkaXVtPWVtYWlsJnV0bV9zb3VyY2U9bmV3c2xldHRlciZ1dG1fdGVybT0yMjAyMjgmdXRtX2NhbXBhaWduPW1vbmV5c3R1ZmY/5ffc7c709470997ea156044aBdf9ccd87), China will push other countries to adopt its digital yuan, everyone  will use Bitcoin, etc. But it is also arguably bad for global  prosperity: Trustworthy rules-based trade works better and produces more value than arbitrary uncertain trade.

You did something good — made something  somebody wanted, let somebody else use something you own, went to work  and did everything the boss told you? Good for you, you get a cookie. Or more precisely, you get a credit, in both senses, in the personal  record kept for you at a bank. Now you want something for yourself? OK,  but that is going to be subtracted from the running total of how much  you’ve done for the rest for us.

If your rating  is too low, you aren’t allowed to fly on a plane. Think about that — a  number assigned to every person, adjusted based on somebody’s judgment  of your pro-social or anti-social behavior. If your number is too low,  you can’t on a plane. If it’s really low, you can’t even get on a bus.  Could you imagine a system like that in the US?**

> The judgment of society can, in all sorts of ways, be bad. Pervasive social credit systems seem dystopian, and you would not really want the U.S.  government making day-to-day decisions about who deserves to keep their  bank accounts. But another idea is that money can insulate you from the obligations of society, and that is also bad. You get a claim on goods  and services by being part of society, and having a big number next to  your name on a list does not relieve you of your obligations. If you do  something so outrageous that society as a whole decides you are a  pariah, then money is a way for society to express that.

> Similarly there are absolutely ways around the hegemony of the dollar (and  the euro, pound, yen, Swiss franc, stock and bond markets, SWIFT, etc.)  if you want them. Russia can [ trade with China](https://link.mail.bloombergbusiness.com/click/26861424.211848/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmxvb21iZXJnLmNvbS9uZXdzL2FydGljbGVzLzIwMjItMDItMjgvc2FuY3Rpb25zLW9uLXJ1c3NpYS1wdXRzLWZvY3VzLW9uLWNoaW5hLXMtY2VudHJhbC1iYW5rP2NtcGlkPUJCRDAyMjgyMl9NT05FWVNUVUZGJnV0bV9tZWRpdW09ZW1haWwmdXRtX3NvdXJjZT1uZXdzbGV0dGVyJnV0bV90ZXJtPTIyMDIyOCZ1dG1fY2FtcGFpZ249bW9uZXlzdHVmZg/5ffc7c709470997ea156044aB42225843) using yuan, or digital yuan or whatever; Russia can surely do some  business with somebody in Bitcoin. Russia can use Bitcoin or yuan or  rubles to buy things from people who (1) want to deal with Russia and  (2) are willing to accept Bitcoin or yuan or rubles. The implicit bet of these sanctions is that *those people are worse*, that the people whom Russia *wants* to deal with are the ones who trade in dollars or euros or pounds or  francs. The bet of these sanctions is that the dollar represents a  society — not just the U.S., but a global community of dollar users  — and that that society is reflected in both a set of values that abhors the invasion of Ukraine, and in an economic system that other countries want access to, even if those countries do not share those values. It  is a bet that economic power and moral values are connected. I’m not  sure that that bet is right, but it’s a nice idea.
