To construct the ideas, I built upon [this impressive 600-page piece of historical scholarship from Tom Holland.](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/68u9oqnndns8hk55g2duo/reh8hohqr58mk8u2/aHR0cHM6Ly9hbXpuLnRvLzN1UzYyWDQ=) He argues the Bible defines Western thought, even if we’ve painted over those ideas with Enlightenment notions of truth and reason. On that  note, it’s filled with golden nuggets like this: “That all men had been  created equal, and endowed with an inalienable right to life, liberty  and the pursuit of happiness, were not remotely self-evident truths… The truest and ultimate seedbed of the American republic—no matter what  some of those who had composed its founding documents might have cared  to think—was the book of Genesis.” What a provocative argument. For an  introduction, I recommend this [video interview](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/68u9oqnndns8hk55g2duo/vqh3hrhn7k5olvcg/aHR0cHM6Ly95b3V0dS5iZS8tcUdma0ZsWktnQQ==) and this [book review](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/68u9oqnndns8hk55g2duo/l2hehmho9kgle4f6/aHR0cHM6Ly90aGVjcml0aWMuY28udWsvaXNzdWVzL2RlY2VtYmVyLTIwMTkvZXRlcm5hbC1yZXN1cnJlY3Rpb24v).



[**Northrop Frye’s Biblical Lectures**](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/68u9oqnndns8hk55g2duo/e0hph7hkgnx76nb8/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1sYlRJQXRvNVByUSZsaXN0PVBMWVFWMTRpbDlYQUxsX2xUWmJnYkJkckZXZGNMT3dLQnM=)**:** This 25-part series explores the synthesis between the Bible and English  Literature. It’s worth watching because the Bible infuses just about  every aspect of civilization. To the extent the ideas feel obvious, it’s only because they’ve been so influential. They’ve become the water we  swim in. Northrop Frye's lectures explore the metaphorical side of these canonical texts. In one of his lectures, Frye said: “The accuracy of  history in the Bible is in inverse proportion to its spiritual value.” [You’ll find a full transcript and show notes for every lecture here. ](https://click.convertkit-mail.com/68u9oqnndns8hk55g2duo/7qh7h8h074g9q0tz/aHR0cHM6Ly9oZXJpdGFnZS51dG9yb250by5jYS9mcnllL2Z1bGwtbGVjdHVyZXM=)
