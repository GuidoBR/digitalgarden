## [My God, It’s Full of Stars: Henrietta Leavitt, Edwin Hubble, and Our Human Hunger to Know the Universe (Tracy K. Smith Reads Tracy K. Smith)](https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/02/11/universe-in-verse-animated-hubble/)

> In 1908, [Henrietta Swan Leavitt](https://www.themarginalian.org/2018/04/03/the-habits-of-light-anna-leahy-henrietta-leavitt-ann-hamilton/) — one of the women known as the [Harvard Computers](https://www.themarginalian.org/2016/12/06/the-glass-universe-dava-sobel/), who changed our understanding of the universe long before they could vote — was analyzing photographic plates at the Harvard Observatory, singlehandedly measuring and cataloguing more than 2,000 variable stars — stars that pulsate like lighthouse beacons — when she began noticing a consistent correlation between their brightness and their blinking pattern. That correlation would allow astronomers to measure their distance for the first time, furnishing the yardstick of the cosmos.
