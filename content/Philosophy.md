### Comments

Love your breakdown! It's a great list.
One comment: 'Critique of Pure Reason' and 'Being and Time' are two of the most important and influential philosophy texts of all time; they're also two of the most difficult (add in Hegel's 'Phenomenology of Spirit' and you have the whole trifecta). I wouldn't push beginning philosophy readers into that deep end just yet; they'll catch their death of German. More concise introductions to those philosophers' thoughts are **Kant's 'Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics'** and **Heidegger's essay "What is Metaphysics?"**.
In addition, regarding the order of presentation, I'd read Descartes before Hume and Wittgenstein before Ayer (order of who influenced who).
To this list I'd add **Nietzsche's 'Thus Spake Zarathustra'** (particularly if your tastes are more toward literature than straightforward philosophy). Solid runners-up include **Spinoza's 'Ethics'**, **Kierkegaard's 'Concluding Unscientific Postscript**', and **Bertrand Russell's 'The Problems of Philosophy'**.
Anyone interested in more contemporary, life-relevant philosophical thought could benefit from **Robert Nozick's 'The Examined Life'.**

### Comments

As a philosophy major, I recommend: 

1 - Philosophy 101 by Paul Klienman 

2 - Philosophy of the Mind: A Beginner's Guide by Ian Ravenscroft 

3 - First Meditations by Descartes 

4 - Epistemology by Fumerton 

5 - The Analects by Confucius  



Online, use the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, and Crash Course Philosophy. Both are great for ultra beginners.
