> The purists in the house will hate on summaries. They’ll say you should only read first-hand sources, as if the knowledge you pick up in summaries doesn’t count. Though there’s wisdom in that perspective, they forget that summaries are an on-boarding ramp to reading the actual book, just music festival recordings. [Eli Dourado’s summary](https://elidourado.com/blog/the-use-of-knowledge-in-society/) of *The Use of Knowledge in Society* inspired me to read Hayek and I only read *Seeing Like a State* after [Venkatesh Rao summarized it](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/).
