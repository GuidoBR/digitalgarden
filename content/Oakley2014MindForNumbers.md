# Highlights from the book "A Mind for Numbers"

## On Habits

> Procrastination is a single, monumentally important “keystone” bad habit.

> Procrastination is like addiction.

> In the  insightful book The Power of Habit, author Charles Duhigg describes a  lost soul—Lisa Allen, a middle-aged woman who had always struggled with  her weight, who had begun drinking and smoking when she was sixteen, and whose husband had left her for another woman. Lisa had never held a job for more than a year and had fallen deeply into debt. But in a  four-year span, Lisa turned her life around completely. She lost sixty  pounds, was working toward a master’s degree, stopped drinking and  smoking, and was so fit that she ran a marathon.

> Habits such as procrastination have four parts: 
>
> - The cue 
> - The routine 
> - The reward 
> - The belief

> Change a  habit by responding differently to a cue, or even avoiding that cue  altogether. Reward and belief make the change long-lasting. Focus on the process (the way you spend your time) instead of the product (what you  want to accomplish).

> Use the  twenty-five-minute Pomodoro to stay productive for brief periods. Then  reward yourself after each successful period of focused attention.

## On finding beauty in Math and Science

> “What, after  all, is mathematics but the poetry of the mind, and what is poetry but  the mathematics of the heart?” —David Eugene Smith, American  mathematician and educator

> Mandelbrot's in heaven
> At least he will be when he's dead
> Right now he's still alive and teaching math at Yale
>
> Gave us order out of chaos
> He gave us hope where there was none
> His geometry succeeds where other fail
>
> If you ever lose your way
> A butterfly will flap its wings
> From a million miles away
> A little miracle will come to take you home
>
> from Mandelbrot Set, song by Jonathan Coulton

> There are  hidden meanings in equations, just as there are in poetry. If you are a  novice looking at an equation in physics, and you’re not taught how to  see the life underlying the symbols, the lines will look dead to you. It is when you begin to learn and supply the hidden text that the meaning  slips, slides, then finally leaps to life.

> In a classic  paper, physicist Jeffrey Prentis compares how a brand-new student of  physics and a mature physicist look at equations. The equation is seen  by the novice as just one more thing to memorize in a vast collection of unrelated equations. More advanced students and physicists, however,  see with their mind’s eye the meaning beneath the equation, including  how it fits into the big picture, and even a sense of how the parts of  the equation feel.

> “A  mathematician who is not at the same time something of a poet will never be a full mathematician.” —German mathematician Karl Weierstrass

> One of the  most important things we can do when we are trying to learn math and  science is to bring the abstract ideas to life in our minds.

## On being a active learner

> Research has  shown that students learn best when they themselves are actively engaged in the subject instead of simply listening to someone else speak.

> “What a  wonderful stimulant it would be for the beginner if his instructor,  instead of amazing and dismaying him with the sublimity of great past  achievements, would reveal instead the origin of each scientific  discovery, the series of errors and missteps that preceded  it—information that, from a human perspective, is essential to an accurate explanation of the discovery.”

> Inventor and  author William Kamkwamba, born in 1987 in Africa, could not afford to  attend school. So he began teaching himself by going to his village’s  library, where he stumbled across a book titled Using Energy. But  Kamkwamba didn’t just read the book. When he was only fifteen years old, he used the book to guide him in active learning: He built his own  windmill. His neighbors called him misala—crazy—but his creation helped  begin generating electricity and running water for his village and  sparked the growth of grassroots technological innovation in Africa.

> **Taking responsibility for your own learning is one of the most important things you can do.**

> Celso  Batalha, for example, a renowned professor of physics at Evergreen  Valley College, has set up a popular reading group for his students  about learning how to learn. And many professors use “active” and  “collaborative teaching” techniques in the classroom that give students a chance to actively engage with the material and with each other.

> “*The Man Who  Knew Infinity: A Life of the Genius Ramanujan*", by Robert Kanigel. This  book tells the unbelievable, rags to intellectual riches story of the  Indian mathematical genius Srinivasa Ramanujan and his friend British  mathematician G. H. Hardy. My favorite episode is this:

> “*Men of  Mathematics*, by E. T. Bell. This is an old classic that’s a  show-stopping read for anyone who’s interested in how fascinating people think. Who could forget brilliant, doomed Évariste Galois who spent the night before he knew he was to die ‘feverishly dashing off his last  will and testament, writing against time to glean a few of the great  things in his teeming mind before the death which he foresaw could  overtake him. Time after time he broke off to scribble in the margin “I  have not time; I have not time,” and passed on to the next frantically  scrawled outline.’ Truth be told, this is one of the few exciting  stories that Professor Bell perhaps exaggerated, although Galois  unquestionably spent that last evening putting the final polish on his  life’s work. But this brilliant book has inspired generations of both  men and women.”

## On Focused and Diffuse mode

> Focused-mode  thinking is essential for studying math and science. It involves a  direct approach to solving problems using rational, sequential,  analytical approaches. The focused mode is associated with the  concentrating abilities of the brain’s pre-frontal cortex, located right  behind your forehead.

> Diffuse-mode  thinking is also essential for learning math and science. It allows us  to suddenly gain a new insight on a problem we’ve been struggling with  and is associated with “big-picture” perspectives. Diffuse-mode thinking is what happens when you relax your attention and just let your mind  wander.

> If you are  trying to understand or figure out something new, your best bet is to  turn off your precision-focused thinking and turn on your “big picture”  diffuse mode,

> The harder you push your brain to come up with something creative, the less creative your ideas will be.

>  Evidence  suggests that to grapple with a difficult problem, we must first put  hard, focused-mode effort into it. (We learned that in grade school!)  Here’s the interesting part: The diffuse mode is also often an important part of problem solving, especially when the problem is difficult. But  as long as we are consciously focusing on a problem, we are blocking the diffuse mode.

> One  remarkably inventive chemist of the mid-1800s, Alexander Williamson,  observed that a solitary walk was worth a week in the laboratory in  helping him progress in his work. (Lucky for him there were no  smartphones then.) Walking spurs creativity in many fields; a number of  famous writers, such as Jane Austen, Carl Sandburg, and Charles Dickens, found inspiration during their frequent long walks.

> Once you are  distracted from the problem at hand, the diffuse mode has access and can begin pinging about in its big-picture way to settle on a solution.

> In other  words, just using your diffuse mode doesn’t mean you can lollygag around and expect to get anywhere. As the days and weeks pass, it’s the  distributed practice—the back and forth between focused-mode attention  and diffuse-mode relaxation—that does the trick.

> General  Diffuse-Mode Activators 
>
> - Go to the gym 
> - Play a sport like soccer or  basketball 
> - Jog, walk, or swim 
> - Dance 
> - Go for a drive (or tag along for the ride) 
> - Draw or paint 
> - Take a bath or shower 
> - Listen to music, especially  without words 
> - Play songs you know well on a musical instrument 
> - Meditate  or pray 
> - Sleep (the ultimate diffuse mode!)

> Figuring out a difficult problem or learning a new concept almost always requires one  or more periods when you aren’t consciously working on the problem. Each interlude in which you are not directly focused on the problem allows  your diffuse mode to look at it in a fresh way. When you turn your  focused attention back to the problem, you consolidate new ideas and  patterns that the diffuse mode has delivered.

> Use the  focused mode to first start grappling with concepts and problems in math and science. After you’ve done your first hard focused work, allow the  diffuse mode to take over. Relax and do something different!

> Be sure to schedule free time to nurture your diffuse mode.

> REACHING  TOWARD THE INFINITE 
>
> Some feel that diffuse, intuitive ways of thinking  are more in tune with our spirituality. The creativity that diffuse  thinking promotes sometimes seems beyond human understanding. As Albert  Einstein noted, “There are only two ways to live your life. One is as  though nothing is a miracle. The other is as if everything is.”

## 10 Rules of Good Studying

1. **Use recall**. After you read a page, look away and recall the main ideas. Highlight very little, and
   never highlight anything you haven’t put in your mind first by recalling. Try recalling main ideas
   when you are walking to class or in a different room from where you originally learned it. An
   ability to recall – to generate the ideas from inside yourself – is one of the key indicators of good
   learning.
2. **Test yourself**. On everything. All the time. Flash cards are your friend.
3. **Chunk your problems**. Chunking is understanding and practicing with a problem solution so that it
   can all come to mind in a flash. After you solve a problem, rehearse it. Make sure you can solve it
   cold – every step. Pretend it’s a song and learn to play it over and over again in your mind, so the
   information combines into one smooth chunk you can pull up whenever you want.
4. **Space your repetition**. Spread out your learning in any subject a little every day, just like an athlete.
   Your brain is like a muscle – it can handle only a limited amount of exercise on one subject at a
   time.
5. **Alternate different problem-solving techniques during your practice**. Never practice too long at
   any one session using only one problem solving technique – after a while, you are just mimicking
   what you did on the previous problem. Mix it up and work on different types of problems. This
   teaches you both how and when to use a technique. (Books generally are not set up this way, so
   you’ll need to do this on your own.) After every assignment and test, go over your errors, make
   sure you understand why you made them, and then rework your solutions. To study most
   effectively, handwrite (don’t type) a problem on one side of a flash card and the solution on the
   other. (Handwriting builds stronger neural structures in memory than typing). You might also
   photograph the card if you want to load it into a study app on your smartphone. Quiz yourself
   randomly on different type of problems. Another way to do this is to randomly flip through your
   book, pick out a problem, and see whether you can solve it cold.
6. **Take Breaks**. It is common to be unable to solve problems or figure out concepts in math or science
   the first time you encounter them. This is why a little study every day is much better than a lot of
   studying all at once. When you get frustrated with a math or science problem, take a break so that
   another part of your mind can take over and work in the background.
7. **Use explanatory questioning and simple analogies**. Whenever you are struggling with a concept,
   think to yourself, How can I explain this so that a ten-year-old could understand it? Using an
   analogy really helps, like saying that the flow of electricity is like the flow of water. Don’t just
   think your explanation – say it out loud or put it in writing. The additional effect of speaking and
   writing allows you to more deeply encode (that is, covert into neural memory structures) what you
   are learning.
8. **Focus**. Turn off all interrupting beeps and alarms on your phone and computer, and then turn on a
   timer for twenty-five minutes. Focus intently for those twenty-five minutes and try to work as
   diligently as you can. After the timer goes off, give yourself a small, fun reward. A few of these
   sessions in a day can really move your studies forward. Try to set up time and places where
   studying, not glancing at your computer or phone – is just something you naturally do.
9. **Eat your frogs first**. Do the hardest thing earliest in the day, when you are fresh.
10. **Make a mental contrast**. Imagine where you’ve come from and contrast that with the dream of
    where your studies will take you. Post a picture or words in your workspace to remind you of your
    dream. Look at that when you find your motivation lagging. This work will pay off both for you
    and those you love!

## Ten Rules of Bad Studying

1. **Passive rereading**—sitting passively and running your eyes back over a page. Unless you can prove that the material is moving into your brain by recalling the main ideas without looking at the page, rereading is a waste of time. 
2. **Letting highlights overwhelm you**. Highlighting your text can fool your mind into thinking you are putting something in your brain, when all you’re really doing is moving your hand. A little highlighting here and there is okay—sometimes it can be helpful in flagging important points. But if you are using highlighting as a memory tool, make sure that what you mark is also going into your brain. 
3. **Merely glancing at a problem’s solution and thinking you know how to do it**. This is one of the worst errors students make while studying. You need to be able to solve a problem step-by-step, without looking at the solution. 
4. **Waiting until the last minute to study**. Would you cram at the last minute if you were practicing for a track meet? Your brain is like a muscle—it can handle only a limited amount of exercise on one subject at a time. 
5. **Repeatedly solving problems of the same type that you already know how to solve.** If you just sit around solving similar problems during your practice, you’re not actually preparing for a test—it’s like preparing for a big basketball game by just practicing your dribbling. 
6. **Letting study sessions with friends turn into chat sessions**. Checking your problem solving with friends, and quizzing one another on what you know, can make learning more enjoyable, expose flaws in your thinking, and deepen your learning. But if your joint study sessions turn to fun before the work is done, you’re wasting your time and should find another study group. 
7. **Neglecting to read the textbook before you start working problems.** Would you dive into a pool before you knew how to swim? The textbook is your swimming instructor—it guides you toward the answers. You will flounder and waste your time if you don’t bother to read it. Before you begin to read, however, take a quick glance over the chapter or section to get a sense of what it’s about. 
8. **Not checking with your instructors or classmates to clear up points of confusion**. Professors are used to lost students coming in for guidance—it’s our job to help you. The students we worry about are the ones who don’t come in. Don’t be one of those students. 
9. **Thinking you can learn deeply when you are being constantly distracted**. Every tiny pull toward an instant message or conversation means you have less brain power to devote to learning. Every tug of interrupted attention pulls out tiny neural roots before they can grow. 
10. **Not getting enough sleep**. Your brain pieces together problem-solving techniques when you sleep, and it also practices and repeats whatever you put in mind before you go to sleep. Prolonged fatigue allows toxins to build up in the brain that disrupt the neural connections you need to think quickly and well. If you don’t get a good sleep before a test, NOTHING ELSE YOU HAVE DONE WILL MATTER.

## More insights

> This is  precisely why one significant mistake students sometimes make in  learning math and science is jumping into the water before they learn to swim. In other words, they blindly start working on homework without  reading the textbook, attending lectures, viewing online lessons, or speaking with someone knowledgeable. This is a recipe for sinking.

> “Many people  will tell you that they can’t nap. The one thing I learned from a single yoga class I took many years ago was to slow down my breathing. I just  keep breathing slowly in and out and don’t think I must fall asleep.  Instead, I think things like, Sleepytime! and just focus on my  breathing. I also make sure it’s dark in the room, or I cover my eyes  with one of those airplane sleep masks. Also, I set my phone alarm for  twenty-one minutes because turning a short power nap into a longer sleep can leave you groggy. This amount of time gives me what’s basically a  cognitive reboot.”

> Spaced repetition helps move items from working memory to long-term memory.

> one of the  first steps toward gaining expertise in math and science is to create  conceptual chunks—mental leaps that unite separate bits of information  through meaning.

> The first step in chunking, then, is to simply focus your attention on the information you want to chunk.

> Imagine how  your calf muscles would scream if you prepared for a big race by waiting till midnight the night before your first marathon to do your first  practice run. In just the same way, you can’t compete in math and  science if you just cram at the last minute.

> Mental  contrasting is a powerful motivating technique—think about the worst  aspects of your present or past experiences and contrast these with the  upbeat vision of your future.

> A short, helpful guide to getting started with meditation is "*Buddha in Blue Jeans*" by Tai Sheridan.

> It’s normal to sit down with a few negative feelings about beginning your work. It’s how you handle those feelings that matters.

> We develop a  passion for what we are good at. The mistake is thinking that if we  aren’t good at something, we do not have and can never develop a passion for it.

> “Deficiencies of innate ability may be compensated for through persistent hard work  and concentration. One might say that work substitutes for talent, or better yet that it creates talent.”

> I’d like to point educators toward the book *Redirect*, by psychology professor  Timothy Wilson, which describes the seminal importance of  failure-to-success stories (Wilson 2011). Helping students change their  inner narratives forms one of the important goals of this book. A leader in describing the importance of change and growth in mindset is Carol  Dweck (Dweck 2006).

> Differentiation is effectively recursive division, and integration is effectively  recursive multiplication, each carried out indefinitely, i.e., to  infinitesimal values (which is possible because they depend on  convergent series, which themselves are only known by inference, not  direct inspection). This ability to project what an operation entails  when carried out infinitely is what solves Zeno’s paradox, which seems  impossible when stated in words. But in addition to this difficulty, the Leibnizian formalism we now use collapses this infinite recursion into a single character or the integral sign) because one can’t actually keep  writing operations forever. This makes the character manipulation of  calculus even less iconic of the corresponding physical referent.
