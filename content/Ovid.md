**Last on your list of best history books of 2020 is *Ovid: A Very Short Introduction* by Llewellyn Morgan. Why is this a great book?**

I’m not a classicist, but in the three  months of this year that I was allowed out, I just kept coming across  Ovid quite a lot—for instance, the Titian exhibition at the National  Gallery, which was absolutely astounding. Only six paintings, but the  first time that the collection of paintings based upon [*Metamorphoses*](https://fivebooks.com/book/metamorphoses/), which Titian painted for Philip II, have been assembled in a single room for 300 years. Quite extraordinary.

Delving into this, you realise that everyone steals from Ovid—Dante, [Chaucer](https://fivebooks.com/book/chaucer-a-european-life/), [Shakespeare](https://fivebooks.com/books/shakespeare-plays/), James Joyce mentions him, [Ted Hughes](https://fivebooks.com/book/tales-ovid-by-ted-hughes/), Margaret Atwood has a short story about him. Jeffrey Eugenides’s novel, [*Middlesex*](https://fivebooks.com/book/middlesex/), was based upon *Metamorphoses*. Even Enid Blyton adapted him for a children’s book about tales of Ancient Greece. In the world of music, [Handel](https://fivebooks.com/best-books/handel-andrew-gant/), Gluck, Lully, Benjamin Britten—they’ve all adapted tales from Ovid. So, just at a time when I thought I really should know a little bit more  about Ovid, Llewellyn Morgan comes up with this book.

The *Very Short Introductions*, at their best, are really excellent. I’m thinking of [John  Arnold’s introduction to history, for example. It’s a really superb,  very personal account, of the attractions and meaning of history as a  discipline](https://fivebooks.com/book/history-very-short-introduction-john-arnold/). That’s a fascinating one. Sadly, because they’re part of a collection, they’re not often reviewed. But there are some real gems  within them, lots of good ones.

This one is a really loving account of Ovid, with a very simple structure. It takes you through his major works, with the *Metamorphoses* obviously at the centre. It’s also, to a certain extent, a meditation  on exile. Ovid is one of the great figures of exile. It’s very good on  that perspective. It’s a wonderful little book. I can’t think of a  better introduction to the work of this figure who is, arguably, the  single most influential poet of antiquity.

**So, even if you don’t want to  read Ovid, it’s super helpful if you want to read Shakespeare or Dante  or indeed pretty much anyone else. Is that the point?**

Yes. And going back to what we were  talking about before, this is extremely useful when looking at Milton.  It confirms one of my worries about history at the moment. I’ve talked  about language and religion here and the two are often bound up. Unless  you really have some grasp of foreign languages, or the vocabulary of  religions—both of which are rather neglected in Britain today—you can’t  really have any geographical or chronological depth in history. You’re  stuck with the 20th century, the 19th century and probably just the  West.

If you really want to practise history,  then you need languages and you need an understanding of religion and I  think all the books we have talked about, these five books, which range  from Ovid, to Jews in the Reformation, to the Aztec world, to Milton,  this great poet, and to Beethoven—music being a language in itself—all  of them represent the idea that, unless one has some kind of facility in these languages in all their variety, then you’re lost as a historian

# [A criação do imaginário ocidental](https://www.quatrocincoum.com.br/br/resenhas/poesia/a-criacao-do-imaginario-ocidental)

​							As “Metamorfoses” de Ovídio ganham tradução integral para o português, e em versos 					**Ovídio ** 							***Metamorfoses\*** 							  							TRAD. Domingos Lucas Dias; APRES. João Angelo Oliva Neto 							 								Editora 34 •  								912 pp •  								 								R$ 110 							 						 					

Além de ser um clássico da literatura latina, *Metamorfoses*, do romano Públio Ovídio Naso (43 a.C.-17/18 d.C.), é um dos mais  maravilhosos e mais estranhos poemas jamais escritos. A princípio, essa  longa peça, composta de quinze seções, inscreve-se no gênero das  cosmogonias, comum na Antiguidade clássica, dedicado ao relato da origem das coisas, do mundo, dos deuses, dos animais, do homem. E a primeira  seção da obra de fato confirma essa expectativa:
