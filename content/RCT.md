> A **randomized controlled trial** (or **randomized control trial**;[[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial#cite_note-Chalmers-1981-2) **RCT**) is a form of [scientific experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_experiment) used to control factors not under direct experimental control. Examples of RCTs are [clinical trials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trial) that compare the effects of drugs, surgical techniques, [medical devices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medical_device), [diagnostic procedures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagnostic_procedure) or other medical treatments. 
>
> Participants who enroll in RCTs differ from one another in known  and unknown ways that can influence study outcomes, and yet cannot be  directly controlled. By [randomly allocating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_assignment) participants among compared treatments, an RCT enables *statistical control* over these influences. Provided it is designed well, conducted  properly, and enrolls enough participants, an RCT may achieve sufficient control over these [confounding factors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confounding_factor) to deliver a useful comparison of the treatments studied.
