## [Facebook is Other People](https://kevinmunger.substack.com/p/facebook-is-other-people)

> Millions of Americans are *miserable*. The internet has “gotten worse” because Americans *are not ok*. Near-universal internet access means that there are immiserated, lonely people spending many hours a day online. The breakdown in the social  fabric, climbing "prime-age" unemployment and high rates of addiction  and mental illness manifest themselves in our mutually-constructed  online spaces. There is a misery that wants to make itself known--to *inflict* itself on the world--that social media enables. **We are reaping what we've  sown; the interconnectedness enabled by the internet and the gains from  open communication/cooperation cannot succeed while so many are left  behind.**
