[J. Robert Oppenheimer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._Robert_Oppenheimer), American physicist and director of the [Manhattan Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project), learned Sanskrit in 1933 and read the *Bhagavad Gita* in the original form, citing it later as one of the most influential  books to shape his philosophy of life. Oppenheimer later recalled that,  while witnessing the explosion of the [Trinity nuclear test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity_nuclear_test), he thought of verses from the *Bhagavad Gita* (XI,12):

> दिवि सूर्यसहस्रस्य भवेद्युगपदुत्थिता। यदि भाः सदृशी सा स्याद्भासस्तस्य महात्मनः।।११-१२।।[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_of_Bhagavad_Gita#cite_note-8) If the radiance of a thousand suns were to burst at once into the sky, that would be like the splendor of the mighty one...[[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_of_Bhagavad_Gita#cite_note-FOOTNOTEJungk1958201-9)[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_of_Bhagavad_Gita#cite_note-10)

Years later he would explain that another verse had also entered his head at that time:

> We knew the world would not be the  same. A few people laughed, a few people cried. Most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the *Bhagavad Gita*; [Vishnu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishnu) is trying to persuade the [Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjuna) that he should do his duty and, to impress him, takes on [his multi-armed form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vishvarupa) and says, 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds.' I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.[[11\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_of_Bhagavad_Gita#cite_note-The_Decision_to_Drop_the_Bomb-11)[[a\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_of_Bhagavad_Gita#cite_note-16)
