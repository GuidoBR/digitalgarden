“‘Despair, or folly?’ said Gandalf. ‘**It is not despair, for despair is only for those who see the end beyond all doubt. We do not.** It is wisdom to recognize necessity, when all other courses have been  weighed, though as folly it may appear to those who cling to false hope. Well, let folly be our cloak, a veil before the eyes of the Enemy! For  he is very wise, and weighs all things to a nicety in the scales of his  malice. But the only measure that he knows is desire, desire for power;  and so he judges all hearts. Into his heart the thought will not enter  that any will refuse it, that having the Ring we may seek to destroy it. If we seek this, we shall put him out of reckoning.’

‘At least  for a while,’ said Elrond. ‘The road must be trod, but it will be very  hard. And neither strength nor wisdom will carry us far upon it. **This quest may be attempted by the weak with as much hope as the strong. Yet such is oft the course of deeds that move the wheels of the world:  small hands do them because they must, while the eyes of the great are  elsewhere.**’”
