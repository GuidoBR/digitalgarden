> **A Procrustean bed:** “Something designed to produce conformity by unnatural or violent means. In Greek mythology, [Procrustes](https://click.fourhourmail.com/5qu6k9x72ks7hww645c6/6qheh8hpxkm037bo/aHR0cHM6Ly9lbi53aWtpcGVkaWEub3JnL3dpa2kvUHJvY3J1c3Rlcw==) was a robber who tied his victims to a bed, either stretching or  cutting off their legs in order to make them fit it.” (Source: [*Oxford Dictionary of English Idioms*](https://click.fourhourmail.com/5qu6k9x72ks7hww645c6/kkhmh6h8zdk4onal/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9PeGZvcmQtRGljdGlvbmFyeS1FbmdsaXNoLUlkaW9tcy1SZWZlcmVuY2UvZHAvMDE5OTU0Mzc4WC9yZWY9c3JfMV80P2NyaWQ9T1lURTZLQkhCT1NWJmtleXdvcmRzPU94Zm9yZCtEaWN0aW9uYXJ5K29mK0VuZ2xpc2grSWRpb21zJnFpZD0xNjQ1MDQ1NjA3JnNwcmVmaXg9b3hmb3JkK2RpY3Rpb25hcnkrb2YrZW5nbGlzaCtpZGlvbXMlMkNhcHMlMkM2MyZzcj04LTQ=)). Nassim Taleb ([@nntaleb](https://click.fourhourmail.com/5qu6k9x72ks7hww645c6/58hvh7h53vrl4ks6/aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9ubnRhbGVi)) has a related book of aphorisms titled [*The Bed of Procrustes*](https://click.fourhourmail.com/5qu6k9x72ks7hww645c6/25h2hoh7lvknqdt3/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYW1hem9uLmNvbS9CZWQtUHJvY3J1c3Rlcy1QaGlsb3NvcGhpY2FsLVByYWN0aWNhbC1BcGhvcmlzbXMtZWJvb2svZHAvQjAwNEM0M0Y5Uy8=). He explains the title thusly: “Every aphorism here is about a  Procrustean bed of sorts—we humans, facing limits of knowledge, and  things we do not observe, the unseen and the unknown, resolve tension by squeezing life and the world into crisp commoditized ideas, reductive  categories, specific vocabularies, and prepackaged narratives, which, on the occasion, has explosive consequences.” For more, see this animated  YouTube video: [The Bed of Procrustes](https://click.fourhourmail.com/5qu6k9x72ks7hww645c6/qvh8h7h8e79qlqul/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj1sUk5fS1QxN21Obw==).
