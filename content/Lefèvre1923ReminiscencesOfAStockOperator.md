> A stock operator has to fight a lot of expensive enemies within himself.

> Um especulador financeiro tem que lutar contra muitos inimigos caros dentro de si mesmo.

> A man must believe in himself and his judgment if he expects to make a living at this game. That is why I don’t believe in tips. If I buy stocks on Smith’s tip I must sell those same stocks on Smith’s tip. I am depending on him. Suppose Smith is away on a holiday when the selling time comes around? No, sir, nobody can make big money on what someone else tells him to do.

> Um homem deve acreditar em si mesmo e em seu discernimento se espera ganhar a vida neste jogo. É por isso que não acredito em dicas. Se eu comprar ações com base na dica de Smith, terei que vender essas mesmas ações também de acordo com as dicas de Smith. Eu me tornarei dependente dele. E se, quando chegar a hora de vender, Smith estiver em viagem de férias? Não, senhor, ninguém ganha muito dinheiro se tomar decisões a partir dos palpites de outra pessoa

> There is nothing like losing all you have in the world for teaching you what not to do. And when you know what not to do in order not to lose money, you begin to learn what to do in order to win. Did you get that? You begin to learn!

> Não há nada como perder tudo o que você tem no mundo para ensinar a você o que não fazer. E quando você sabe o que não fazer para não perder dinheiro, começa a aprender o que fazer para ganhar dinheiro. Entendeu isso? Você começa a aprender!
