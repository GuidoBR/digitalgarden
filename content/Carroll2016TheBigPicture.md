[Review by Manny, on Good Reads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1618157194?book_show_action=true&from_review_page=1)

*[A cloud in Heaven. PLATO, LUCRETIUS, HUME, LAPLACE, DARWIN, THE REV BAYES and sundry others]*

PLATO: Meeting to order. Manny has asked us to review Sean Carroll's new book. I trust you've all read it?

LUCRETIUS: Say, how come we're writing this for him? What's going on, Plato?

PLATO: I owe Manny a little favor. Fellow-seekers after wisdom, we have  eternity ahead of us. This won't take more than an aeon or two. Who's  first?

LUCRETIUS: Okay, I didn't like it much.

PLATO: Would you care to elaborate, dear Lucretius?

LUCRETIUS: Well, it's a cheap rip-off of *De Rerum Natura*.

HUME: Modest as ever, I see.

LUCRETIUS: Look, he's just updating my formula! Fear not the Gods, fear not death, there is nothing but atoms and void--

LAPLACE: Quantum fields.

LUCRETIUS: Whatever. He's done a good job on the philosophy, I grant you that. But come on guys, he calls it "poetic naturalism" and where's the poetry in his book? 

LAPLACE: Where's the naturalism in yours?

HUME: Touché!

LUCRETIUS: Now Pierre-Simon, you know that's not fair. I was writing in the first century B.C.

LAPLACE: Well, you could have read Aristarchus. Or at least Hipparchus. Sean's naturalism is state of the art. 

*[General murmurs of approval]*

PLATO: With all due respect, brother Lucretius, I think Pierre-Simon makes a  fair point. If one wishes to defend naturalism, an understanding of  nature is required. It is evident that Sean understands these -- ah --  quantum fields very well. And he has a gift for explaining them.

LUCRETIUS: But the hexameters--

PLATO: Sean maybe lacks a feeling for the poetics of words. But he sees the poetics of geometry.

LAPLACE: I enjoyed his geometric demonstration that there can be no occult forces.

PLATO: Yes, his use of the -- what was it called? --

LAPLACE: Feynman diagram.

PLATO: That was it. By turning the Feynman diagram through a right-angle, we  see that all forces must already have revealed themselves. Very elegant. I must remember to show it to Eudoxus. Now, who else has comments?

THE REV BAYES: It is unworthy of me to say this, but I was touched that he believed more in my little rule than in God.

LAPLACE: You did well there, Tom.

THE REV BAYES: Perhaps too well. I fear people like Sean may be disappointed when they find out that--

ALL: Shhh!

THE REV BAYES: I'm sorry, I forgot we were still live. Charles, you look like you want to say something?

DARWIN: Well, I was also flattered that he took me so seriously. But remember, I always left open the question of how life originated. That "warm little pond"--

HUME: It's true, I did feel at times that Sean's  protestations of rigorous scepticism were not entirely justified. I  liked the kind things he said about me too. Though when he told us he  was certain that science would soon understand the emergence of life, it almost sounded like--

THE REV BAYES: Faith? There's nothing wrong with that, you know.

HUME: Yes, but he says science *isn't* faith. I'd have felt reassured if he'd quoted Iris Fry's book. There's a woman after my own heart. But she's not even mentioned.

WEYL: And the same story with the universe's low initial entropy. I wasn't afraid to compare it to a miracle in *my* book. But despite the fact that Sean constantly refers to the Past Condition, there's hardly a word about *why* the world might have started in this extraordinary state.

PLATO: Gentlemen, gentlemen, please! Remember, it's easy for us to nitpick. Sean's just mortal. 

DARWIN: True. Well, he's better than Richard Dawkins. 

VOLTAIRE: And Christopher Hitchens.

WEYL: And Victor Stenger.

THE REV BAYES: Not to mention A.C. Grayling.

*[Elaborate facepalm from VOLTAIRE]*

PLATO: So, all in all, we don't think he's so bad.

LUCRETIUS: No, no, his heart's in the right place. As Pierre-Simon said, he does a good job of explaining the atoms and void.

LAPLACE: Quantum fields.

LUCRETIUS: Whatever. I still can't forgive him for taking out my hexameters. But maybe that's just me. 

PLATO: Thank you Lucretius. Then, I hope that--

HUME: Wait! If Sean's correct about the finality of death, then what are we all doing here?

*[A moment of general consternation]*

WITTGENSTEIN: Relax, everyone. We're only a figure of speech.

PLATO: Ludwig, I don't know what we'd do without you. So, we're giving him a pass? All those in favor--

EVERYONE EXCEPT HUME: Aye. Aye. Aye

HUME: With the caveats already mentioned.

PLATO: Duly noted, David. Now thank you again, gentlemen, you've all been very kind. The first round of ambrosia is on me.
