### [How To Make Friends Easily And Strengthen The Friendships You Have](https://www.bakadesuyo.com/2013/11/how-to-make-friends-easily/)

And this one is key: Support the person’s view of themselves and make them feel good about their pursuits.

Best friends don’t have to share an identity per se, but  they do need to support the other’s view of himself and make each other  feel great about their pursuits. Weisz asked a group of college freshmen  about their close friends and used questionnaires to determine whether  they received social identity support from them. She then followed up  five years later, when the students had graduated and moved off campus. Social  identity support didn’t predict whether the friendships generally  endured, but it did predict whether one of the friends became a best  friend. Part of maintaining a close friendship, Weisz points out, is  supporting someone’s identity as it inevitably shifts over time.

My theory on this: be a cheerleader for your friends.

This is what we all want from our friends. And the more you give it, the more you will get it yourself.

###  [Fruits of Friendship](https://perell.com/essay/fruits-of-friendship/)

	The Buddhists have a name for this: Kalyana-Mitra — a “noble friend.”  Since nobody can see their life totally, they confront people when they  misstep even when doing so is awkward and uncomfortable. Like mirrors,  even when we’re blind to our own actions, the words of a Kalyana-Mitra  reflect your true self.
	
	Once you find a Kalyana-Mitra, invest in their friendship.  Accelerating feedback loops is the fastest way to accelerate your  learning or improve your behavior, and when you give excellent people a  clear window into your life, their feedback will be invaluable.  Unfortunately, most friends can’t really help each other. Since  they don’t communicate with depth, honesty, or frequency, they gloss  over their true challenges, many of which are taboo to discuss. But the  shine on top will never fix the cracks beneath the surface.
	
	When you speak with somebody at length, you realize that everybody —  yes, everybody — faces a waterfall of challenges. In difficult moments,  friends serve as guides. Through dialogue and feedback, they help us  navigate the unknown, alleviate suffering, and dodge the bullets of  everyday life.

### [The High Price of Mistrust](https://fs.blog/2021/01/mistrust/)

Book: Bowling Aloe

“Just as a screwdriver (physical capital) or a college education (human capital) can increase productivity (both individual and collective), so too can social contacts affect the productivity of individuals and groups.” For example, knowing the right people can help you find a job where your skills are well utilized. If you don’t know many people, you might struggle to find work and end up doing something you’re overqualified for or be unemployed for a while.

To give another example, if you’re friends with other parents in your  local neighborhood, you can coordinate with them to share childcare  responsibilities. If you’re not, you’re likely to end up paying for  childcare or being more limited in what you can do when your kids are  home from school.

Both individuals and groups have social capital. Putnam also explains that “social  capital also can have externalities that affect the wider community, so  that not all of the costs and benefits of social connections accrue to  the person making the contact . . . even a poorly connected individual  may derive some of the spillover benefits from living in a  well-connected community.” A well-connected community is usually a  safer community, and the safety extends, at least partly, to the least  connected members.

Social capital enables us to trust other people. When we’re connected to many others, we develop a norm of “generalized reciprocity.” Putnam explains this as meaning “I’ll do this for you without expecting anything specific back from you, in the confident expectation that someone else will do something for me down the road.” We can go for the delayed payoff that comes from being nice without an agenda. Generalized reciprocity makes all of our interactions with other people easier. It’s a form of trust.

### [Whom We Love and Who We Are: José Ortega y Gasset on Love, Attention, and the Invisible Architecture of Our Being](https://www.brainpickings.org/2021/06/25/jose-ortega-y-gasset-on-love/)

A century and a half after astronomer Maria Mitchell — a key figure in Figuring — observed that “whatever our degree of friends may be, we come more under their influence than we are aware,” Ortega laments:
We do not take into sufficient consideration the enormous influence which our loves exercise upon our lives.

The century of psychology developed since Ortega’s epoch has illuminated just how much “who we are and who we become depends, in part, on whom we [[love]].

### [Trailblazing Astronomer Maria Mitchell on How We Co-Create Each Other and Recreate Ourselves Through Friendship](https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/09/10/maria-mitchell-friendship/)

“Whatever our degree of friends may be, we come more under their influence than we are aware.”

“We can count on so few people to go that hard way with us,” Adrienne Rich wrote in her exquisite meditation on the art of honorable human relationships. While it is hard enough to inoculate the integrity of the word “friend” against today’s epidemic of misuse and overuse, it can be even harder to calibrate our expectations of those who have earned the benediction of the title — the chosen few we have admitted into the innermost chambers of the heart and entrusted with going that hard way with us. “Ponder for a long time whether you shall admit a given person to your friendship,” Seneca counseled in contemplating true and false friendship, “but when you have decided to admit him, welcome him with all your heart and soul.”  Two millennia later, the question of whom to welcome and to what extent remains one of the most delicate discernments with which life tasks us.

	A friend is not to be found in the world such as one can conceive of, such as one needs, for no human being unites so many of the attributes of God as we feel our nature requires…. We have therefore a circle whom we call friends, giving a name to the whole, which perhaps in its singular occupation might be used for the combination. Out of the whole circle we may make up a single friend. We [[love]] them all but we [[love]] the union of all better.
	
	Who judges a work of art and sees only with his own eyes?  Who listens to a lecture and hears only with his own ears? We turn  aslant as we stand before the picture to see what good judges are  looking. We open the guide book to see what we ought to admire….  Insensibly our judgment is inspired by that of those around us. It is  not a weakness to be deplored. We were more than conceited did we rate  ourselves so much above the rest of the world that we needed no outward  aids to judgment. We were born dependent, our happiness is in the hands  of others. Our character is molded by them and receives its coloring  from them as much as our feeling relates the parental impress.

### [Seneca on True and False Friendship](https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/05/19/seneca-friendship/)


“Friendship is unnecessary,” C.S. Lewis wrote, “like philosophy, like art, like the universe itself… it has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.”

	If you consider any man a friend whom you do not trust as  you trust yourself, you are mightily mistaken and you do not  sufficiently understand what true friendship means… When friendship is  settled, you must trust; before friendship is formed, you must pass  judgment. Those persons indeed put last first and confound their duties,  who … judge a man after they have made him their friend, instead of  making him their friend after they have judged him. Ponder for a long  time whether you shall admit a given person to your friendship; but when  you have decided to admit him, welcome him with all your heart and  soul. Speak as boldly with him as with yourself… Regard him as loyal and  you will make him loyal.
	
	--
	
	He who regards himself only, and enters upon friendships  for this reason, reckons wrongly. The end will be like the beginning: he  has made friends with one who might assist him out of bondage; at the  first rattle of the chain such a friend will desert him. These are the  so-called “fair-weather” friendships; one who is chosen for the sake of  utility will be satisfactory only so long as he is useful. Hence  prosperous men are blockaded by troops of friends; but those who have  failed stand amid vast loneliness their friends fleeing from the very  crisis which is to test their worth. Hence, also, we notice those many  shameful cases of persons who, through fear, desert or betray. The  beginning and the end cannot but harmonize. He who begins to be your  friend because it pays will also cease because it pays. A man will be  attracted by some reward offered in exchange for his friendship, if he  be attracted by aught in friendship other than friendship itself.
	
	--
	
	For what purpose, then, do I make a man my friend? In  order to have someone for whom I may die, whom I may follow into exile,  against whose death I may stake my own life, and pay the pledge, too.
	
	Friendship produces between us a partnership in all our  interests. There is no such thing as good or bad fortune for the  individual; we live in common. And no one can live happily who has  regard to himself alone and transforms everything into a question of his  own utility; you must live for your neighbour, if you would live for  yourself. This fellowship, maintained with scrupulous care, which makes  us mingle as men with our fellow-men and holds that the human race have  certain rights in common, is also of great help in cherishing the more  intimate fellowship which is based on friendship… For he that has much  in common with a fellow-man will have all things in common with a  friend.

### [C.S. Lewis on True Friendship](https://www.brainpickings.org/2014/09/08/c-s-lewis-four-loves-friendship/)

	In a circle of true Friends each man is simply what he is: stands for  nothing but himself. No one cares twopence about anyone else’s family,  profession, class, income, race, or previous history. Of course you will  get to know about most of these in the end. But casually. They will  come out bit by bit, to furnish an illustration or an analogy, to serve  as pegs for an anecdote; never for their own sake. That is the  kingliness of Friendship. We meet like sovereign princes of independent  states, abroad, on neutral ground, freed from our contexts. This [[love]]  (essentially) ignores not only our physical bodies but that whole  embodiment which consists of our family, job, past and connections. At  home, besides being Peter or Jane, we also bear a general character;  husband or wife, brother or sister, chief, colleague, or subordinate.  Not among our Friends. It is an affair of disentangled, or stripped,  minds. Eros will have naked bodies; Friendship naked personalities.
	
	Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art, like the universe itself… It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.

### [Amizade segundo Cortella: ‘Ter amigos nos lembra que não somos estrelas solitárias’](https://gamarevista.uol.com.br/semana/cade-seus-amigos/mario-sergio-cortella-fala-sobre-ter-amigos-e-relacoes-de-amizade)

> Amizade dá trabalho, não dá para ter uma amizade que seja uma carga leve. A amizade, tal como a parentalidade, como a responsabilidade sobre outras pessoas, é marcada por aquilo que o grande Antoine de Saint-Exupéry escreveu em “O Pequeno Príncipe”: “Tu és eternamente responsável por aquilo que cativas”. O uso do verbo cativar está em um sentido duplo, cativar como sedução e também como aprisionamento. Uma amizade que não exija luta pode enfraquecer ao ponto de se esvair. O maior distanciamento não é o distanciamento físico ou temporal, é o distanciamento de almas, isso que leva não quando uma pessoa pensa diferentemente de mim, mas quando ela me trai. A amizade não admite a traição; o amor admite, a paixão também. Mas a traição e a ingratidão são elementos que não cabem no conceito de amizade. 
> (...)
> Ter amigos e amigas é importante sempre porque lembra cada um que não somos estrelas solitárias, somos constelação; a vida é constelação. Algumas dessas estrelas das constelações onde estamos brilham mais ou menos; outras estão no tempo e dentro de nós, porque nossos amigos e amigas não são somente as pessoas com quem convivemos, algumas já se foram mas continuam com a gente.
> (...)
> A amizade recusa o abandono, o isolamento; é uma forma de se distanciar da sensação de estar sozinho. É uma maneira de ter um adensamento da nossa vitalidade, da presença, do sentido, do pertencimento.

### [Anam Cara and the Essence of True Friendship: Poet and Philosopher John O’Donohue on the Beautiful Ancient Celtic Notion of Soul-Friend](https://themarginalian.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=13eb080d8a315477042e0d5b1&id=254508ce13&e=40b458beb6)

Aristotle laid out the philosophical foundation of friendship as [the art of holding up a mirror to each other’s souls](https://themarginalian.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=13eb080d8a315477042e0d5b1&id=acef54a201&e=40b458beb6). Two millennia later, Emerson contemplated its [two pillars of truth and tenderness](https://themarginalian.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=13eb080d8a315477042e0d5b1&id=ff74624161&e=40b458beb6). Another century later, [C.S. Lewis wrote](https://themarginalian.us2.list-manage.com/track/click?u=13eb080d8a315477042e0d5b1&id=7f0434468d&e=40b458beb6): *“Friendship is unnecessary, like philosophy, like art, like the universe itself… It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.”*



> In the Celtic tradition, there is a beautiful understanding of love and friendship. One of the fascinating ideas here is the idea of soul-love; the old Gaelic term for this is *anam cara*. *Anam* is the Gaelic word for soul and *cara* is the word for friend. So *anam cara* in the Celtic world was the “soul friend.” In the early Celtic church, a person who acted as a teacher, companion, or spiritual guide was called an *anam cara*. It originally referred to someone to whom you confessed, revealing the hidden intimacies of your life. With the *anam cara* you could share your inner-most self, your mind and your heart. This friendship was an act of recognition and belonging. When you had an *anam cara*, your friendship cut across all convention, morality, and category. You were joined in an ancient and eternal way with the “friend of your soul.” The Celtic understanding did not set limitations of space or time on the soul. There is no cage for the soul. The soul is a divine light that flows into you and into your Other. This art of belonging awakened and fostered a deep and special companionship.

[**AMIZADE NOS LIVROS SAPIENCIAIS**](https://www.cnbb.org.br/amizade-nos-livros-sapienciais/)

**Ser amigo das Virtudes**

O homem que deseja ser fiel a Deus, conservando suas Palavras em seu coração e praticando os seus preceitos, é chamado a se fazer amigo da Sabedoria, dessa forma evitará ser seduzido pelo mal (cf. Pr 7,1-5). Esse mal pode se apresentar a nós também através de pessoas que espertamente desejam-se fazer nossos amigos. Mas o homem sábio é cauteloso em suas amizades (cf. Pv 12,26). 

No cântico dos cânticos a bonita amada é também chamada de amiga (cf. Ct 6,3-4) que se encanta com a formosura estética e moral do seu amado e seu amigo (cf. Ct 5,16). É muito interessante essa relação íntima entre a beleza física e aquela moral. Como sempre se diz na filosofia: há uma íntima relação entre ética e estética. A estética das relações interpessoais é chamada ter um componente ético, ou seja, a paixão pelo bem. Por isso não é bem-vinda a relação entre amizade e criminalidade. 

**A Amizade como sinal de Sabedoria** 

Na diversidade das citações sobre a Amizade no livro da Sabedoria e do Eclesiástico encontramos a relação entre a beleza da amizade e o sentido da vida. Amizades autênticas contribuem para o enriquecimento das pessoas; a Amizade é uma relação que potencializa o sentido da vida e a alegria do viver. 

Quem rejeita a experiência da amizade e da justiça, faz aliança com a morte (cf. Sb 1,16). “A sabedoria é um espírito amigo dos homens…” (Sb 7,6). O valor positivo da Amizade vem da sua conexão com a sabedoria e, esta por sua vez, está vinculada à verdade e a justiça. Por isso os Amigos rejeitam a murmuração e evitam a maledicência (cf. Sb 7,11). O espírito da Sabedoria é imaculado, lúcido, invulnerável, amigo do bem, sutil, livre, benéfico, amigo dos homens, estável, seguro (cf. Sb 7,22-23). Quem segue a Sabedoria pertence a Deus, o amigo da vida (cf. Sb 11, 2). 

**Recomendações importantes**

No Livro dos Provérbios encontramos várias recomendações muito significativas sobre a importância da Amizade. Quem é movido pela sabedoria detesta o perverso, mas é amigo dos justos (cf. Pr 3,32). “Quem busca amizade disfarça a ofensa; mas quem a repete afasta o amigo” (Pr 17,9). Esse versículo nos apresenta a importância da experiência da resiliência entre os amigos, que significa não levar em conta incômodos e males causados por eles, mas isso não pode se tornar um hábito, caso contrário os amigos se desgastam e se vão (cf. Eclo 22,20.22). 

Apesar disso, um verdadeiro amigo ama em todas as circunstâncias (cf. Pr 17,17). Todavia, a mesma sabedoria adverte que a riqueza multiplica os amigos, pois todo mundo se faz amigo de quem gosta de dar presente e quer ser bajulado, a pobreza provoca abandono (cf. Pr 19,4-6). O texto nos adverte para a importância dos discernimento dos verdadeiros dos falsos amigos; há quem se apresente como nossos amigos somente na abundância; mas é na pobreza que a amizade se confirma. 

Recomenda-se também a importância da firmeza para com os amigos como senso de educação: “O tapa do amigo é leal, mas o beijo do inimigo é mentiroso” (Pr 27,6). Isso significa que os amigos verdadeiros não ficam bajulando-se mutuamente, indiferentes aos males, mas são honestos e sinceros uns com os outros, e não pode admitir entre si a falsidade. Por causa da dimensão educativa da Amizade, “o conselho de amigo acalma o ânimo. Não abandone o seu amigo nem o amigo de seu pai” (Pr 27,8-10). “Mas quem se faz amigo dos corruptos envergonha seu pai” (Pr 28,7). 

Há muitas outras recomendações valiosas e permanentes, como por exemplo: “Não troque um amigo por dinheiro” (Eclo 7,18); “Não abandone um velho amigo” (Eclo 9,10); “O amigo não se revela na prosperidade” (Eclo 12,8); “Faça o bem ao amigo e reparta com ele conforme suas posses” (Eclo 14,13). Esses conselhos nos indicam o reconhecimento do valor da amizade, a importância da lealdade, a necessidade da prudência, da paciência e da prática da solidariedade entre os amigos. 

**O perfil do verdadeiro amigo**

A prudência no falar contribui para a longevidade da amizade. Por isso, recomenda-se: “Seja constante no modo de pensar e coerente na maneira de falar. Esteja pronto para ouvir e lento para dar a resposta… Falar pode trazer honra ou desonra, e a língua do homem é a sua ruína. Não tenha fama de caluniador, nem use a língua para preparar armadilhas, porque para o ladrão existe a vergonha, e para o homem falso uma condenação severa. Evite erros grandes e pequenos, e de amigo não se transforme em inimigo” (Eclo 5,10-15). “Palavras afáveis aumentam os amigos, e fala amável encontra acolhida” (Eclo 6,5). 

É preciso não ter pressa na amizade, por isso, adverte o Eclesiástico que é necessário saber escolher o confidente, pois o tempo e as circunstâncias provarão quem são os nossos verdadeiros amigos. “Tenha muitos conhecidos, mas um só confidente entre mil. Se você quiser um amigo, coloque-o à prova, e não vá logo confiando nele. Porque existe amigo de ocasião, que não será fiel quando você estiver na pior. Existe amigo que se transforma em inimigo, e envergonhará você, revelando suas coisas particulares. Existe amigo que é companheiro de mesa, mas que não será fiel quando você estiver na pior. Quando tudo correr bem, ele estará com você, mas quando as coisas forem mal, ele fugirá para longe” (Eclo 6,6-11). 

“Amigo fiel é proteção poderosa, e quem o encontrar, terá encontrado um tesouro. Amigo fiel não tem preço, e o seu valor é incalculável. Amigo fiel é remédio que cura, e os que temem ao Senhor o encontrarão. Quem teme ao Senhor tem amigos verdadeiros, pois tal e qual ele é, assim será o seu amigo” (Eclo 7,15-17). 

A amizade é sagrada relação de confiança; por isso o Eclesiástico nos apresenta uma séria reflexão sobre a confidencialidade; a ruptura da confiança gera a perda da amizade. “Quem revela o segredo destrói a confiança, e nunca mais encontrará um amigo íntimo. Ame o seu amigo e seja fiel a ele. Contudo, se você revelou os segredos dele, não o procure mais. Porque, assim como se perde uma pessoa que morre, da mesma forma você perdeu a amizade do seu próximo. Como pássaro que escapa da mão, você deixou escapar seu amigo, e não conseguirá mais apanhá-lo” (Eclo 27,16-19). 

A amizade implica fidelidade em todas as circunstâncias: “Todo amigo declara amizade, mas existe amigo que é amigo só de nome… O companheiro se alegra com o amigo na felicidade, mas no momento da desgraça torna-se hostil. O companheiro sofre com o amigo por interesse, mas no momento da briga toma o escudo. Em seu coração não se esqueça do amigo; e não se esqueça dele quando você estiver na prosperidade” (Eclo 37,1.3-6). 

# [Simone Weil on the Paradox of Friendship and Separation](https://www.themarginalian.org/2015/08/24/simone-weil-friendship-separation/)

> The joy of meeting and the sorrow of separation … we should welcome these gifts … with our whole soul, and experience to the full, and with the same gratitude, all the sweetness or bitterness as the case may be. Meeting and separation are two forms of friendship that contain the same good, in the one case through pleasure and in the other through sorrow… Soon there will be distance between us. Let us love this distance which is wholly woven of friendship, for those who do not love each other are not separated.

> Dear Friend,
>
> It seems as though the time has now really come for us to say goodbye to each other… Human existence is so fragile a thing and exposed to such dangers that I cannot love without trembling.
>
> […]
>
> I also like to think that after the slight shock of separation you will not feel any sorrow … and that if you should sometimes happen to think of me you will do so as one thinks of a book one read in childhood. I do not want ever to occupy a different place from that in the hearts of those I love, because then I can be sure of never causing them any unhappiness.

# [The Best Teacher (or Friend) is a Good Book](https://christopherperrin.substack.com/p/the-best-teacher-or-friend-is-a-good)

> There is a strange idea abroad that in every subject the ancient books should be read only by the professionals, and that the amateur should content himself with the modern books. Thus I have found as a tutor in English Literature that if the average student wants to find out something about Platonism, the very last thing he thinks of doing is to take a translation of Plato off the library shelf and read the *Symposium*. He would rather read some dreary modern book ten times as long, all about “isms” and influences and only once in twelve pages telling him what Plato actually said. The error is rather an amiable one, for it springs from humility. The student is half afraid to meet one of the great philosophers face to face. He feels himself inadequate and thinks he will not understand him. But if he only knew, the great man, just because of his greatness, is much more intelligible than his modern commentator. The simplest student will be able to understand, if not all, yet a very great deal of what Plato said; but hardly anyone can understand some modern books on Platonism. It has always therefore been one of my main endeavours as a teacher to persuade the young that firsthand knowledge is not only more worth acquiring than secondhand knowledge, but is usually much easier and more delightful to acquire.



> We all know the value of a good book placed in our hands at the right time. We give and receive books as gifts; we likely all can remember a particularly meaningful book that helped and possibly changed us. Perhaps you still have books you grew up with and treasured. Maybe you read through all of the *Chronicles of Narnia* and the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy–several times. Perhaps characters like Peter or Lucy or Bilbo or Aragorn remain dear to you. If so, the names of C.S. Lewis and J.R.R. Tolkien may have a kind of magical quality to them for the characters have become your friends and you owe them a great debt of gratitude for introducing these characters to you, yes, even for creating them. 
>
> Some have grown up in the imagined worlds of Narnia or Middle Earth or similar imagined worlds from the likes of Lewis Carroll, A. A. Milne, and Beatrix Potter. **Great books, even great children’s books, may have shaped you deeply, even helping to form your moral universe and understanding. One chemistry professor I know grew up outside of any church tradition but found his moral life shaped by the *Lord of the Rings* trilogy of Tolkien, which he read and reread. When tempted to join various dubious activities, he found himself saying, “No. Aragorn would never do that.” What a great friend is Aragorn—but the better friend is Tolkien who made the introduction.**

      Mas é certo que vos amo.

      Nem sempre os que estão mais perto
      fazem melhor companhia.

      Por vosso amor é que penso
      e me dou tantos trabalhos.

      Não condeneis, por enquanto,
      minha rebelde maneira.
      Para libertar-me tanto,
      fico vossa prisioneira.

      Por mais que longe pareça,
      ides na minha lembrança,
      ides na minha cabeça,
      valeis a minha Esperança

7. Poema: [*Amigo*, de Alexandre O'Neill](https://www.culturagenial.com/maiores-poemas-amizade-literatura-brasileira-portuguesa/)

   1. Mal nos conhecemos
      Inauguramos a palavra amigo!

      Amigo é um sorriso
      De boca em boca,
      Um olhar bem limpo

      Uma casa, mesmo modesta, que se oferece.
      Um coração pronto a pulsar
      Na nossa mão!

      Amigo (recordam-se, vocês aí,
      Escrupulosos detritos?)
      Amigo é o contrário de inimigo!

      Amigo é o erro corrigido,
      Não o erro perseguido, explorado.
      É a verdade partilhada, praticada.

      Amigo é a solidão derrotada!

      Amigo é uma grande tarefa,
      Um trabalho sem fim,
      Um espaço útil, um tempo fértil,
      Amigo vai ser, é já uma grande festa!
