# [How the Blog Broke the Web](https://stackingthebricks.com/how-blogs-broke-the-web/)

> And the damn reverse chronology bias â€” *once called into creation, it hungers eternally* â€” sought its next victim. Myspace. Facebook. Twitter. Instagram.  Pinterest, of all things. Today these social publishing tools are  beginning to buck reverse chronological sort; theyâ€™re introducing  algorithm sort, to surface content not by time posted but by popularity, or expected interactions, based on individual and group history. There  is even less control than ever before.

> There are no more quirky homepages.
>
> There are no more amateur research librarians.
>
> All thanks to a quirky bit of software produced to alleviate the pain of a tiny subset of a very small audience.

> Thatâ€™s not cool at all.



# [ðŸŒ± My blog is a digital garden, not a blog](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)

> For as long as I've been writing words  on the internet, I've connected the words that I create in a paginated  chronological format. This is the "traditional" blog style website. A  linear newest-first sorted chronologically oriented list of posts.
>
> I'm convinced that paginated posted sorted chronologically fuckin' sucks.

> Chronologically sorted pages of posts aren't how people actually use the internet.

> Another layer of discovery is curation.

> Curation comes **before** a chronological list. 



# [A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)

> A garden is a collection of evolving  ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date.  They're inherently exploratory â€“ notes are linked through contextual  associations.  They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as  half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites  we're used to seeing.

> At the 2015 Digital Learning Research Network, Mike Caufield delivered a keynote on [The Garden and the Stream: a Technopastoral](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY&feature=emb_logo). It later becomes [a hefty essay](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral) that lays the foundations for our current understanding of the term. **If anyone should be considered the original source of \*digital gardening\*, it's Caufield.** They are the first to lay out this whole idea in poetic, coherent words. 
>
> Caufield makes clear digital gardening is not about specific tools â€“ it's not a  Wordpress plugin, Gastby theme, or Jekyll template. It's a **different way of thinking about our online behaviour around information** - one that accumulates personal knowledge over time in an explorable space.
>
> Caufield's main argument was that we have become swept away by  *streams* â€“ the collapse of information into single-track timelines of events.   The conversational feed design of email inboxes, group chats, and  InstaTwitBook is fleeting â€“ they're only concerned with self-assertive  immediate thoughts that rush by us in a few moments. 
>
> This is not inherently bad. Streams have their time and place. Twitter is a  force-multiplier for exploratory thoughts and delightful encounters once you fall in with the right crowd and learn to play the game.
>
> But streams only surface the Zetigeisty ideas of the last 24 hours. They  are not designed to accumulate knowledge, connect disparate information, or mature over time. 
>
> The *garden* is our counterbalance. **Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time.** (...) You get to actively choose which curiosity trail to follow, rather than  defaulting to the algorithmically-filtered ephemeral stream. **The garden helps us move away from time-bound streams and into contextual knowledge spaces.**
