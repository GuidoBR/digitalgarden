# How to think like a Roman Emperor

In "How to think like a Roman Emperor" by Donald Robertson, readers are taken on a captivating journey into the wisdom of ancient Stoicism through the lens of one of its most renowned practitioners, Marcus Aurelius. The author pierces together historical narrative, philosophical and psychological insights with practical exercises, offering a compelling guide for modern readers seeking timeless wisdom in the pursuit of a more meaningful, resilient and happy life. The book provides a thoughtful exploration of Marcus Aurelius' life and teachings (by explaining relevant passages of Meditations) and it also serves as a guide to applying Stoic principles to contemporary challenges.

In this book Robertson shows the [parallels between the wisdom of Stoicism and the science-based Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)](https://medium.com/stoicism-philosophy-as-a-way-of-life/stoic-philosophy-as-a-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-597fbeba786a), highligthing their profound interconnection. The author states that both [Stoicism and CBT](https://digitalgarden.guidopercu.dev/how-to-think-like-a-roman-emperor#note_1) share a fundamental emphasis on recognizing and reframing distorted thought patterns, fostering resilience and cultivating a rational mindset in the face of life's challenges. The practical techniques of Stoicism such as negative visualization and cognitive restructuring align with strategies employed in CBT. It's the philosophical approach to the contemporary psychology of well-being.

> The Stoics can teach you how to find a sense of purpose in life, how to face adversity, how to conquer anger within yourself, moderate your desires, experience healthy sources of joy, endure pain and illness patiently and with dignity, exhibit courage in the face of your anxieties, cope with loss, and perhaps even confront your own mortality while remaining as unperturbed as Socrates.

Stoicism's relevance in the modern world lies in its timeless wisdom and practical applicability to the challenges of contemporary life. In an era marked by rapid change, constant distractions, and heightened stress, Stoicism provides a philosophical anchor, offering individuals a guide to navigating tumultuous waters with resilience and inner strength. The emphasis on virtue, self-discipline, and the distinction between what can and cannot be controlled resonates deeply in a society grappling with uncertainty. Moreover, the Stoic emphasis on mindfulness, ethical decision-making, and the pursuit of tranquility aligns seamlessly with contemporary discussions on mental well-being and personal development. 

In a rapidly changing world where institutionalized religion holds less sway and science alone doesn't provide a comprehensive guide for life, individuals seeking meaning and stability are increasingly turning to Stoicism as a source of guidance for virtuous living. As traditional religious affiliations wane in significance, people often find themselves in search of alternative frameworks. In this vacuum, the resurgence of interest in Stoicism becomes evident, manifesting across various domains such as business, politics, and self-development. The contemporary quest for gurus and self-help resources reflects a yearning for practical philosophies that transcend religious dogma and scientific abstraction. This renewed attention to Stoicism is evident in the proliferation of new books, videos, lectures, and podcasts dedicated to its principles, reinforcing its cultural relevance as a timeless and adaptable guide for navigating the complexities of modern life.

I had the enriching experience of delving into "How to Think Like a Roman Emperor" alongside "Meditations" and a biography of Marcus Aurelius by Pierre Grimal, and the synergy among these works was truly remarkable. Each book complemented and enhanced the insights of the others, creating a holistic understanding of Marcus Aurelius and Stoic philosophy. I highly recommend this multidimensional approach, as tackling "Meditations" alone can prove challenging without the historical context. Donald Robertson's book serves as an invaluable companion, providing a nuanced perspective that enriches the reading of Aurelius' meditative reflections. Engaging with these works together offers a more comprehensive and rewarding experience, bridging the gap between our contemporary world and the profound wisdom of ancient Stoicism.

## Main themes of the book:

1. What is stoicism and it's history
2. How to speak with wisdom
3. How to follow your values
4. How to conquer your desires
5. How to cope with pain
6. How to deal with anger, fear and anxiety
7. Death

   1. > To learn how to die, according to the Stoics, is to unlearn how to be a slave.

   2. > As death is among the most certain things in life, to a man of wisdom it should be among the least feared.

   3. > They felt the pain of loss but did not succumb to it. Marcus has been bereaved so many times, has practiced his response to it so often, that he no longer weeps uncontrollably. He no longer cries “Why?” and “How could this happen?” or even entertains such thoughts. He has firmly grasped the truth that death is both a natural and inevitable part of life.

   4. > “Go to the rising sun,” he said, “for I am already setting.”

   5. > Never say that anything has been lost, they tell us. Only that it has returned to Nature.
