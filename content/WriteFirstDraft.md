# [Preparing Fragments Helps You to Ease Into Writing](https://zettelkasten.de/posts/ease-into-writing/)

> This is the process which will help you write a complete first draft in no time:
>
> 1. Get an overview of your knowledge.
> 2. Create a first outline to plan the writing project.
> 3. Attach notes from your archive to the outline’s items.
> 4. Fill in the gaps with more research.  Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you’re satisfied.
> 5. Copy and paste note contents into a document according to the outline.
> 6. Re-write the manuscript.

The process for [[writing]] based on the books and research should separate the note-making from the writing of the first draft. Create a garden of ideas, with small snippets of texts ([[fragments-of-ideas]]) that can be reused into your final content.
